This is a demo and test program for the virtual serial port module of
superbitrf. It creates several virtual serial interfaces as well as a DFU stub
for firmware upgrade purposes. Each serial interface can be connected to and
interacted with.
The test.py python script which is included is able to test the amount of
successfull transactions done between the console and the data virtual serial
ports.
